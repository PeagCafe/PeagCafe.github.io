Introduction
------------

Andreas Antonopolous came up with the idea of RIPCORD blockchains. A
cryptocurrency is only worth considering if its revolutionary,
immutable, public, collaborative, open, resistant, and decentralized.

What Andreas may not have seen is that RIPCORD also describes key
aspects of the Christian message, the gospel---or good news---of Jesus
of Nazareth.

The RIPCORD gospel
------------------

### Revolutionary

God becoming man is revolutionary. This changed history forever. Jesus'
incarnation lifts humanity into the Godhead. His death heals human
rebellion against God. His Spirit declared him to be Son of God with
power by his resurrection.

### Immutable

Jesus is immutable. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
forever. Because he does not change, his people rest secure, as God's
promises always hold true in him.

### Public

Jesus' gospel is public. The first of eyewitnesses to his resurrection
were women---in an age where women were generally disregarded. Skeptics
and questioners are welcome. Anyone can come see, verify, read the Bible
for themselves.

### Collaborative

Jesus brings people into his family, the collaborative global community
called the church. He calls us to work out our own salvation with fear
and trembling, as his Spirit works to make us more like him, that we
might together carry his good news to the world.

### Open

The good news of Jesus is open. He welcomes all who call on him,
regardless of race, sex, socioeconomic status, or anything else that
separates people. Everyone who calls on his name will be saved.

### Resistant

Jesus' resurrection gives strength to resist evil. He taught his
followers to pray, ''deliver us from evil.'' He equips his people to
resist personal, societal, and spiritual evil. Christians served the
sick in plague-infested Rome, adopted abandoned babies, freed slaves,
defended women, and many died martyers' deaths witnessing to Christ.

### Decentralized

The gospel of Jesus is decentralized. Jesus resurrection is the proof
his work on the cross was sufficient, that he earned all authority. Yet
surprisingly, he shares this authority: by his blood he purchased from
every tribe and language and people and nation a kingdom of people who
will reign eternally for him. He restores his decentralized people to
the original task of filling the earth and reigning for God's glory!

Conclusion
----------

Jesus' preeminence shines through bitcoin, the RIPCORD blockchain. Each
of the RIPCORD adjectives describes an aspect of the gospel of Jesus.

Our present crisis is far deeper, far more profound than simply broken
money. Fixing the money doesn't fix the human heart. The broken
relationship between God and humanity touches every dimension of life:
our relationship to God, to other people, to ourselves, and to the
environment.

To fix the money, grab the bitcoin RIPCORD. But to really live, grab
hold of Jesus, the RIPCORD whose death and resurrection changes
everything.
