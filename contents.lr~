Everybody uses money. Young children ask their parents why can't we just get more of it. Yet if we stop to think about it, we may find it difficult to explain to our five-year old *what* money even *is*.

With this website, I hope to reflect theologically on money and creation, economics and truth, in the light of God's Word.
