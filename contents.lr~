Everybody uses money. Children ask their parents why can't we just get more of it. Yet if we stop to think about it, we may find it difficult to explain to a five-year old *what* money even *is*.

Money points beyond itself. According to the Bible, the cosmos speaks without words to reveal God's eternal power and divine nature (Psalm 19, Romans 1). With this website, I hope to reflect theologically on money and creation, economics and truth, in the light of God's Word.
